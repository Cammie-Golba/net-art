          Many people around the world have to deal with rodents living in their house.
          This is not a new phenomenon, and one that will never truly go away until said rodents
          are given a place to live for themselves. 
          Recently, individuals have found mice crawling around in their homes, <a href="mice.html">but also their technology.</a>
          Computer scientists and website managers can not figure out where they came from
          or how to get rid of them. 
          <br>
          <br>
          These mice do not cause a probelm but merely exist, what should we do with this information?
          People are still scared of these mice. But those same people won't get rid of
          their technology either. Sceientists will be hard at work trying to solve this problem.
